# Getting Started
To get started, download/clone this repository onto your desktop. This repository contains the actual live code we use on the site, and with it all the starter mods.

_Make sure to follow us on Twitter [@3Betters](http://3betters.com) to stay current with the project._

### Just JavaScript and HTML
All you'll need to know is [a little JavaScript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp). The site is built using [jQuery](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/), [jQuery Mobile](http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/dist/demos/) and [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/), so they are already available if you need them. Finally, all the textual content is just plain HTML, but we definitely recommend just sticking with [Markdown](https://stackedit.io/) as it's easier to use and frees you from having to learn HTML too (we use Markdown ourselves).

You'll also want a browser with a good console for development, we recommend [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/).
